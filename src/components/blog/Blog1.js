                    Hiring a Freelancer VS. Hiring A Software Development
                    Agency: Which One is Better?
                  </h2>
                  <p className="excert">
                    It’s a common problem for anyone who has a business idea but
                    needs a developer to turn the idea into reality. There are
                    so many freelancers and development companies that claim to
                    be able to do what you need, it can be hard to know where.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When it comes to outsourcing, the decision is not always
                    clear. Hiring a freelancer is a lot different than hiring a
                    software development agency. An agency has a team of experts
                    who specialize in a variety of areas.So, when it comes to
                    hiring a freelancer or a software development agency, which
                    one should you choose? The decision you make now will
                    influence the future success of your project.

                      Freelancers suit to small and simple projects but if you
                      want to build something professional – software
                      development company is the best option. You can pay less
                      and get higher risk that something won’t work, or make
                      sure that everything will be okay with a guarantee of
                      further support. Freelancers are collecting tasks rather
                      than focusing on a good quality of a product. Freelancer
                      developers usually build an app or a website as fast as
                      possible, so they can take another task and earn more
                      money.

                  <h2>Hiring freelancers</h2>
                  <h2>Cons</h2>
                  <h5>Quality of Work</h5>
                  <p>
                    Not all hired contractors are concerned with the quality of
                    their work. Most individuals or companies , do not have
                    expertise  in vetting the freelancers thoroughly. So it's as
                    if you run into someone whose only goal is to make a quick
                    buck and get through the project as quickly as possible. For
                    such freelancers, reputational risks are not of the utmost
                    importance because they can always create a new profile or
                    work anonymously.
                  </p>
                  <h5>May Disappear</h5>
                  <p>
                    Well, the disappearance is a really frustrating thing. Just
                    imagine, all conditions, terms, and payment to have been
                    specified, the project to be launched.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then one day the developer might simply have gone silent and
                    become a fantom. It might sound like a horror story, but if
                    you choose to work with unreliable freelance platforms or
                    individual contractors that have no real means to guarantee
                    you the delivery, that’s exactly what can happen. So, keep
                    it in mind and be ready with plan B, just in case.
                  </p>
                  <h5>High Risk</h5>
                  <p>
                    Freelancers are risky not because they will fill your
                    website with bugs and malware, but because they are only one
                    person. Your freelance developer could be the most
                    trustworthy person available, but if they get sick, go on
                    vacation, or encounter a personal emergency, your entire
                    project enters limbo. And if you don’t have a contingency
                    plan in the event of an accident or uncontrollable
                    interference, the project could fall apart entirely.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Organizational Difficulties</h5>{" "}
                  <p>
                    Working with a freelancer can be tricky, they juggle several
                    clients, which can lead to mistakes and delays in your
                    product. And it’s important to know what they’re capable of.
                    If they get confused or run into any problems, you could be
                    looking at a faulty product. So it’s better to stipulate
                    deadlines, not for the very last day.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Confidentiality concerns</h5>
                  <p>
                    Unless you sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with
                    freelancers. If privacy is a concern for you, at AkilTech.co
                    , we strongly recommend signing the NDAs before you start
                    working with any new freelancer. Otherwise, be sure: there
                    are certain risks for data leakage. Especially, for
                    companies with a high conspiracy or classified information.
                  </p>
                  <h5>No Maintenance & Support</h5>
                  <p>
                    After building a website, mob application, or evolving some
                    tools, the remote developer completes the job and usually
                    does not provide further maintenance. So, if you just hired
                    someone to do the project from scratch and then lose them
                    from your sight, you will have to find other freelancers to
                    occasionally fix the bugs and do the maintenance. And you’ll
                    be lucky if the first person you hired did a good job and
                    their code is readable. Otherwise, you end up with awful
                    heritage code no one would be able to maintain and support.
                    Next thing you do then? Start the whole project from scratch
                    and hope it turns out better this time.

                  <h2>Hiring a Software Development Company</h2>
                  <h6>
                    Hiring a development agency means you can get all of your
                    work done, cleared up, and rely on professional assistance.
                    They’re reliable and accountable — someone who’s ready to
                    comply with work processes and procedures, ensuring
                    security. A successful outsourcing business usually has on
                    board the representatives of nearly all professions: the
                    developers of websites/mobile apps, testers, product
                    managers, content makers, designers, analysts, etc. The
                    operation process is split into small stages
                    (sprints/iterations) along which monitoring, analysis, and
                    required customization are made.
                  </h6>
                  <h2>Pros</h2>
                  <h5>World-className product</h5>
                  <p>
                    There are very limited websites or application which are
                    highly appreciated and developed by the freelancers. All the
                    attractive, smooth, appealing solutions are always designed
                    by the group of people working in a team. Classier and
                    productive work is achieved by the team as it is well said
                    that a group of mind work can perform great while a single
                    head
                  </p>
                  <h5>Maintenance & support</h5>
                  <p>
                    Qualified companies are focused on building long-term
                    relationships with customers and, of course, upselling more
                    services. Therefore, they are always the first to offer
                    their services for maintaining the created/existing
                    products, fix bugs, and, if necessary, suggesting any
                    modification of functionality and other refinements.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Full Package</h5>
                  <p>
                    They offer a whole cycle of services such as consulting,
                    business idea estimating, business analysis, and structuring
                    strategies. That’d be a great plus for startups or
                    self-starting entrepreneurs who have money but don’t have
                    the needed knowledge and skills.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Clear Deadline</h5>
                  <p>
                    You receive weekly (daily/monthly – depending on the agreed
                    conditions) progress reports. During the development
                    process, you can monitor the reports, contact the project
                    manager and ask for the necessary refinements. Caring about
                    their reputation, good software development companies are
                    highly responsive to meet all the agreed deadlines.
                    Stability and risks’ absence – here’s what you obtain by
                    signing an agreement with the software development company.
                    Legislation and open financial records reassure that the
                    work will be definitely done and on time. You also don’t
                    have to work out the contract, but only to read/check and
                    sign a prepared contract.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Reputation & customer care</h5>
                  <p>
                    Great outsourcing businesses become great because they do a
                    great job. Everything is simple here:{" "}
                    <ul>
                      <li>agencies make a great project/product </li>
                      <li>
                        they get a lot of positive feedback and their reputation
                        grows{" "}
                      </li>
                      <li>the number of new clients increases.</li>
                    </ul>
                    A satisfied customer brings two customers and a dissatisfied
                    one steals ten
                  </p>
                  <h2>Conclusion: Whom You Should Choose</h2>
                  <p>
                    From the very start of this post, we point out that there is
                    no universal response whether you should opt to cooperate
                    with the freelancer or with a whole development agency.
                    Software development companies have the resources and the
                    expertise to complete projects on a larger scale, but
                    freelancers have other benefits, such as lower costs. It
                    really depends on your specific project and what you’re
                    looking for. Both software development agency and a
                    freelancer have their pros and cons.
                  </p>
                  <h6>
                    To help you decide, ask the following questions to yourself
                    before choosing between a freelancer and a team of software
                    development:
                  </h6>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Is your project big?</li>
                    <li>How many technologies does it cover?</li>
                    <li>Can you manage a project on your own?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Remember to find a contractor whose experience matches your
                    needs and never decide on cost alone. Software development
                    companies may assit you save money in the long run. Finally,
                    make sure to protect your own interests about intellectual
                    property and legal concerns. We hope this will help you make
                    a wise choice.
